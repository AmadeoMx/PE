includesEtoys
	"Strictly speaking, we always include Etoys. However, this method refers
	to the fact that in order to save some disk space some releases 
	(such as Conectar Igualdad) require us to package both Etoys and PE
	together, so if that is the case we need to include a lot of Etoys files 
	(such as the Quickguides and project examples)"
