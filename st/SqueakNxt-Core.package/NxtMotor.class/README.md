I represent a motor that can be attached to the LegoNxt.

#brake - Stops the motor instantly.
#float - Stops the motor but keeps the inertia.
#power - Returns the current speed of the motor.
#power: - Lets you set the speed of the motor.
#resetRelative: - I don't know yet...
#rotation - Returns the angle of the motor (I don't know how to interpret this info yet)
