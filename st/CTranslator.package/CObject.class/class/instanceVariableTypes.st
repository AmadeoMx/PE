instanceVariableTypes
	"This method will be automaticaly generated for subclasses whenever a subclass of CObject is compiled. It returns the information of the inst vars' type. I choose to do it this way (instead of using an class inst var) to ensure the type info will be saved when we file out this class or store it using Monticello"
