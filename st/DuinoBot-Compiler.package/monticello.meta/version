I follow the same incantations DuinoPack 0.4 uses to talk to avr-gcc and avr-g++ but somehow that didn''t work just yet. I had to update the avr version because it seems DuinoPack was using an old version (I don''t know how that works for them, though). That still wasn''t enough, now the program compiled and were uploaded to the board, but they didn''t work as expected. I found that the new DuinoBot core links a few extra files:	- CppLib.h	- main.cppBoth files were unnecesary. In the case of "main.cpp" I was already generating the correct "main" function. And in the case of "CppLib.h", I''ve already defined two libraries for the same purpose: "CppFix.h" (which actually works) and "CXAPureVirtualFix.h". It should work now, right? No. After removing these files from the includes, it still didn''t work. Looking in the "main.cpp" files from the RobotGroup guys, I found a misterious code:	//##RG.Labs.20110318 begin	// This must be included, otherwise the optimizer make strange things.	Serial.begin(9600);	//##RG.Labs.20110318 endI have no idea why, but when I added this line of code to the "main" function, it started to work fine. So, now both direct and compiled mode works with DuinoBot.
